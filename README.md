# PocketGuard Application

 I have developed "PocketGuard," a simple software tool to assist university students in managing their daily finances. The primary goal is to record expenses and monitor budget limits to prevent overspending.

* Auto-Save: All data is securely saved to a CSV file.

# Technologies Used

1.  Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2.  Open the folder PocketGuard_GUI in VS Code.
3.  In the terminal, kindly execute the command:
